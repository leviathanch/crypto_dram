The idea is to protect the DRAM from extraction by an attacker using for instance the cold boot attack\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack}},
by having the store and fetch operations being piped through a crypto unit which then transparently encrypts and decrypts the data using a key which
is dynamically generated during power up.
